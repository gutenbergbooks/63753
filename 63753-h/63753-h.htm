<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>A SECOND
LETTER, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>, <a
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a></p>
<p>It has been satisfactory to me to receive, from many excellent
and well-informed persons, assurances of their entire concurrence
in the sentiments of my former Letter.&nbsp; I am neither
surprised nor alarmed to find myself assailed, in other quarters,
by loud and severe animadversions.&nbsp; You, Sir, have occupied
an intermediate ground.&nbsp; You are too well aware of the
particular circumstances which occasioned my letter, <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>to accuse me of
a gratuitous interference in a wearisome and unthankful
controversy.&nbsp; Your strictures, therefore, are confined to
some particular points in my argument, which you regard as
requiring further elucidation.&nbsp; And you urge me, not so much
for your own satisfaction as for that of others, to take the same
opportunity of clearing away some misapprehensions to which, in
the judgment of persons unacquainted with my opinions, my former
Letter may have been exposed.</p>
<p>Half, and more than half, the arguments of my Reviewers would
have been felt by themselves to be irrelevant, if they had taken
the trouble to observe the circumstances under which my Letter
was written.&nbsp; It was not to the general question of the
observance of the Sunday, nor even of the extent to which it may
be right that the Post Office should observe it, that my remarks
were directed.&nbsp; The question before me was this.&nbsp; I am
urged, as an act of religious duty, to protest against a
particular Order of the Government.&nbsp; I am told, in the most
sacred place, that a particular <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Regulation of the London Post Office
is to be regarded no less as an affront to religion, and a
violation of the rights of conscience, than as an infraction of
the liberties of England.&nbsp; An examination of the question
leads me to an opposite conclusion.&nbsp; I believe that the
measure thus stigmatized will, so far as it extends, promote
rather than impede the interests of religion, will, on the whole,
facilitate rather than interfere with the attendance of that
class which it concerns upon the ordinances of worship, while it
leaves untouched those wider and more general considerations
which would involve, if seriously and consistently entertained, a
revolution in the management of the whole department.&nbsp; I
refuse, therefore, to protest.&nbsp; I refuse to assert, what I
see no reason to believe, that the national observance of the
Lord&rsquo;s Day will suffer from this particular modification of
an existing system.&nbsp; I refuse to assert, what I think it a
most unchristian malignancy to suspect, that the object of this
new Regulation was that which is disavowed and repudiated by its
authors.&nbsp; I cannot discover in it an insidious <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>but resolute
attack upon the holy ordinance of the Christian Sunday.&nbsp; It
would have been in me an act of ridiculous affectation to express
an alarm in which I did not participate; or to remonstrate
against a measure of detail, by way of expressing a principle
which was not at issue.&nbsp; So far, however, my duty was but
negative.&nbsp; It was discharged by refusing my signature.&nbsp;
Nor was it until I heard that refusal (which had ultimately
proved sufficiently general to defeat the remonstrance
altogether) commented upon afterwards, from the pulpit, in terms,
to say the least, of grave disapprobation, that it ever occurred
to me to vindicate myself and others from a suspicion of
indifference or of timidity, by a statement of the real nature
and object of the measure thus impugned.</p>
<p>It was enough, therefore, for my own vindication, enough, I
repeat, to justify my refusal to protest, to show that the mere
transmission of letters through the London Post Office on the
Sunday, taken in connection with its avowed object on the one
hand, and with its concomitant measures <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>of relief on the other, was not that
affront to religion, that disparagement of Divine ordinances,
which alone could necessitate the interposition of a Christian
nation for its discomfiture.&nbsp; This was the object of my
Letter.&nbsp; This object, steadily kept in view, necessarily
confined my argument within narrow limits, and excluded many
topics of discussion to which the opponents of the measure would
gladly divert our attention.</p>
<p>For example, a Clerical antagonist, <a
name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a"
class="citation">[5a]</a> for whose character and evident
sincerity I entertain great respect,&mdash;and whose name, as he
well knows, is enough to secure for him at my hands a degree of
forbearance and courtesy which he would think it a dereliction of
duty to reciprocate,&mdash;complains that I have not enunciated
in my Letter any positive opinions of my own as to the grounds of
the observance of the Lord&rsquo;s Day. <a
name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a>&nbsp; To supply this deficiency, he has
had recourse to my published Sermons; <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and, selecting from a Sermon preached
on a particular occasion an incidental notice of the question,
continues his complaint that there also my language on this
subject is vague and unsatisfactory.&nbsp; I can direct him, if a
time of unwonted leisure should ever permit him to avail himself
of the reference, to three consecutive Discourses on the
Lord&rsquo;s Day, contained in a volume of Parochial Sermons,
published four years ago, in which I have entered fully into the
discussion, and expressed myself in language to which I still
heartily subscribe.&nbsp; You, my dear Sir, will not require to
be informed, that there, as everywhere, I have spoken of the
Lord&rsquo;s Day, as every Christian man must speak and think of
it, with veneration, with thankfulness, with an earnest and
watchful jealousy for its honour.&nbsp; The Author of the
&ldquo;Reply&rdquo; would have expressed himself, doubtless, in
language more eloquent and more impressive, but he could scarcely
have used any more decisive as to his own convictions, than that
in which the national observance of the Sunday is there
enforced.&nbsp; For his <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>information, not for yours, I quote
the sentences which follow. <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, I would desire to press upon you the
responsibility under which the possession of such an ordinance
places us, whether we will hear or whether we will forbear.&nbsp;
A responsibility to God&mdash;for which we must, each and all of
us, give account to Him that is ready to judge the quick and the
dead.&nbsp; But a responsibility also to our country, and to
generations yet perhaps to come.&nbsp; Other nations once had
this privilege of a Christian Sabbath; but they have almost or
utterly sinned it away.&nbsp; They neglected and abused it, till
God took away, by a just retribution, almost the very name of His
day from amongst them.&nbsp; There are countries in Christendom,
in which Sunday is known almost only as a day of amusement or of
common business.&nbsp; England too may one day be brought to this
state, unless our responsibilities are better remembered than
they are now.&nbsp; Let us, at all events, so honour this holy
day ourselves, that our children may inherit it from us as one of
the most precious of all the gifts of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;If ye
know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If any later expression of my opinions be demanded by the
anxious vigilance of my inquisitor, let me add a short passage
from a Sermon preached to a more youthful congregation <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>on the Sunday
before my Letter was written. <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>And shall we, a later, but certainly not a holier
generation, despise and tread underfoot a gift so gracious? <a
name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a>&nbsp; Shall we thanklessly weigh and
measure the amount of observance by which we may avoid
condemnation in the use of it?&nbsp; Shall we either count it a
weekly burden, a deprivation of one seventh part of life&rsquo;s
legitimate enjoyments; or else turn it from a day of heavenly
into one of earthly pleasure, and, because we dare not openly
secularize it, presume to nullify it altogether?&nbsp; My
brethren, be wiser: wiser as to your own good, wiser as to your
own happiness.&nbsp; Be assured that a wasted Sunday is the
precursor of a sinful or an unhappy week.&nbsp; Be assured, on
the other hand, that He whose gift it is&mdash;a gift of love
unspeakable, even of that love which laid down life for
us&mdash;will make it a happy as well as a profitable day, to all
who accept it as His gift, and use it for the purpose of growing
in the knowledge and love of its Giver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have thus far followed the guidance of the Author of the
Reply into a field which I still maintain to be foreign to the
subject.&nbsp; I owe it to myself, and to the office with which I
am entrusted, to leave no room for doubt as to my opinions on so
serious a <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>question of duty, even at the risk of embarrassing for
the moment a discussion which lies properly in a narrower
compass.&nbsp; But the concession, so far as I am concerned,
shall end here.&nbsp; I assumed, throughout my Letter, that the
national observance of the Sunday is a solemn and sacred
duty.&nbsp; But we may surely be allowed to discuss the objects
and probable results of a particular change in the working of the
London Post Office, without obtruding upon our readers the
enquiry whether the Lord&rsquo;s Day is identical with the Jewish
Sabbath, whether the sanctity of the Christian Sunday is derived
from the Law or from the Gospel, from &ldquo;the letter which
killeth&rdquo; or &ldquo;the spirit that giveth
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; If indeed I were one of those who believe
every enactment of the Mosaic Sabbath to be of rigid and
perpetual authority, and who yet do and exact on that day,
without scruple or remorse, acts which, if so, are worthy of
death; or if, while admitting the lawfulness, on that day, for an
individual or for a family, of works neither of mercy, strictly
speaking, nor of necessity, but only of <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span><i>extreme
convenience</i>, (and what more can be said in defence of many of
those domestic arrangements with which, I imagine, even the
Author of the Reply, even on the Sunday, can scarcely dispense?)
I yet denied the possibility of a <i>nations</i> having any such
household duties as even the arrival of the Lord&rsquo;s Day must
rather modify than supersede; if I regarded it as a plain and
obvious sin for a nation, under any circumstances, to suffer any
one of its officers to do any portion of his common work on its
holy day; if, in short, I regarded the question as thus
foreclosed, by a plain and unequivocal revelation of the Divine
will, excluding the consideration of motives, of circumstances,
of consequences, altogether;&mdash;then certainly, sharing my
opponent&rsquo;s principles, I might have used, with more or less
of his severity, something at least of his language; though, even
then, I trust I might have possessed sufficient discernment to
distinguish between a question of principle, and a question of
detail; sufficient respect for the understandings, and regard for
the consistency, of my neighbours, <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to have invited them to a protest
rather against the permission of any Sunday work in any Post
Office, than against a particular adjustment of that burden to
which some had always been subjected.</p>
<p>There is another region, besides, into which I must resolutely
refuse to follow my opponent; the region of personalities.&nbsp;
He is evidently an adept in the occult science of
<i>motives</i>.&nbsp; He speaks, with the irritation of a baffled
magician, of any one whose spirit he cannot discern.&nbsp; He
confesses that I have puzzled him.&nbsp; He is unwilling to
suspect one motive, unable to impute another.&nbsp; The question
is left doubtful. <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a>&nbsp; But it is
otherwise with Mr. Rowland Hill.&nbsp; He lies helplessly open to
the dissecting knife of the operator.&nbsp; And with unflinching
severity is it applied. <a name="citation11b"></a><a
href="#footnote11b" class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; Hostility to
the Sabbath, enmity against religion&mdash;these are visibly his
principles.&nbsp; All else is a veil, a cloke, a mask.&nbsp; When
he speaks of desiring rest on the Sunday for his subordinates, he
means labour.&nbsp; When he prefaces his Minute with the
profession <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>of regard for the Sunday, he speaks but to deceive, and
smiles (<i>vainly</i> smiles, says my Reviewer) at the easy
credulity of his victims. <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; When he not
only promises, but effects, a measure of undeniable
relief,&mdash;the discontinuance, for example, of a second Sunday
delivery,&mdash;this is only to disguise his restless spirit of
antichristian malignity, that he may proceed, more covertly, but
not less surely, to his real object, the annihilation of an
ordinance of God.</p>
<p>I am not the apologist of Mr. Rowland Hill.&nbsp; I know him
only, as all the world knows him, as the originator and
accomplisher of one of the boldest and most beneficial of all the
achievements of modern civilization.&nbsp; It will require more
than mere assertion, to attach to his name those odious
imputations which it is necessary for the impugners of the late
change to suggest and to foster.&nbsp; And what, after all, are
the grounds on which such imputations rest?&nbsp; Mr. Rowland
Hill, says the <i>Record</i>, was a Director of a Railway which
refused Return tickets extending from Saturday to Monday, <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and thus
compelled its passengers to travel on the Sunday. <a
name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Rowland Hill, says the
Author of the Reply, is an officer of that department of the
Government, which is notorious above all others for its
desecration of the Sabbath: <a name="citation13b"></a><a
href="#footnote13b" class="citation">[13b]</a> a department of
the Government, we may add, so beyond all others unfortunate,
that to it alone is denied the possibility of self-reformation,
and every effort after amendment is branded by anticipation as
hypocrisy and imposture.</p>
<p>My antagonist is fond of recurring to first principles.&nbsp;
When he was engaged, some years ago, in what he now denominates
&ldquo;the easy and pleasant task&rdquo; <a
name="citation13c"></a><a href="#footnote13c"
class="citation">[13c]</a> of a somewhat similar controversy with
a very different Correspondent, <a name="citation13d"></a><a
href="#footnote13d" class="citation">[13d]</a> he constructed for
that Gentleman, in a catechetical form, a sort of <i>Rudimenta
Minora</i> of Theology, <a name="citation13e"></a><a
href="#footnote13e" class="citation">[13e]</a> adapted to what he
conceived to be the extent of his religious attainments.&nbsp;
Starting <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>from the immortality of the soul, he descended, by
stages judiciously graduated, to a humbler and more practical
question&mdash;the Sunday labours of the Bath Post Office.&nbsp;
For me, a somewhat more advanced pupil, he has drawn up a
series&mdash;indeed two series <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a>&mdash;of rather less
elementary propositions, ending with this revolting (though
certainly unquestionable) truism, &ldquo;That it is better for
sixty thousand letters to be burned, unopened, than for one Post
Office Clerk to perish in hell for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, if I
might be permitted to assume for a moment an office which my
opponent appears to regard as peculiarly his own, that of a
theological preceptor of adults, I would start, like him, from
some elementary axiom, such as the authority of Revelation, or
the Inspiration of the Bible, and, leading him, by an easy train
of reasoning, through a few brief truisms on the properties of
Christian charity, I should not despair of gaining his
acquiescence at last in this singularly startling paradox, That
it is the duty of every Christian to believe his
neighbour&rsquo;s word until it is <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>proved to be false, and to put upon
his conduct, not the least but the most favourable construction
of which it is reasonably capable.&nbsp; Tried by this test, the
personalities of this question would be scattered to the
winds.&nbsp; It might remain to be considered, whether in the
measure of the Government there had been anything of mistake or
miscalculation; whether their hopes had been too sanguine, or
their assertions too positive; but for imputations of malignant
design, of intentional deception, no place whatever could have
been found.</p>
<p>When the opponents of a measure turn aside from the
consideration of its inherent merits, to that of the secret
motives and intentions of its author, the attempt injures their
cause far more than the success of the attempt could aid
it.&nbsp; No man would resort to such an argument, till all else
had been exhausted.&nbsp; And if unhappily such outrages upon
common honour and morality be excused, as here, by the plea of
zeal for religion, it is well if the cause of religion itself do
not suffer by its association with practices so unworthy.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>But
even upon the merits of the case my Reviewers are ready to join
issue.&nbsp; I am accused of the grossest ignorance of the facts
involved in the discussion.&nbsp; The <i>Record</i>, refraining
with an unwonted tenderness from the imputation of a more corrupt
motive, or unwilling to expend upon a less formidable enemy any
portion of that artillery which must be reserved entire for the
devoted head of Mr. Rowland Hill, is contented to represent me as
&ldquo;a respectable man, occupied for the last three months in
reading nothing but the <i>Times</i>,&rdquo; and an instructive
example of the pernicious influence of its
&ldquo;suppressions.&rdquo; <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; Now, if the
burden of this charge is a preference of the <i>Times</i> to the
<i>Record</i> as a channel of political information, I must plead
guilty.&nbsp; But, if it be intended, as the context implies,
that I borrowed from that or any other Newspaper the statements
of facts contained in my Letter, I can only reply that the charge
is false.&nbsp; Not one assertion is there made, which was not
obtained by explicit information from what every candid enquirer
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>would
regard as the most authentic source.&nbsp; I do not for one
moment hesitate to confess that I regard an official Government
return as better evidence on a question of fact than the
irresponsible publications of a &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Day
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the latter informs me that &ldquo;the
new Sabbath labour already employs a considerably larger number
of men on the Sabbath than was professed by Mr. Hill&rsquo;s
Minute;&rdquo; and if I learn from what I must regard as higher
authority that the amount of extra-work to be done on Sundays in
the London Office will, in all probability, be very shortly
reduced to the employment of <i>six</i> persons, and may
ultimately be accomplished even without <i>any</i> such addition,
nay, with an actual <i>diminution</i> of the original number;
while, at the same time, more than one hundred and ninety
persons, who have hitherto performed regular work on Sundays, are
set entirely free, within the London District itself; can I
hesitate which to follow?</p>
<p>But, on other points, the conflict of evidence is less real
than nominal.&nbsp; The Society for Promoting the Observance of
the <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Lord&rsquo;s Day has forwarded to me a table of returns
from its Secretaries and Correspondents, showing the hours of
labour in seventy-three Country Post Offices, both before and
since the recent Order.&nbsp; It is there stated, that,
&ldquo;putting together all these seventy-three Post Towns, the
aggregate number of additional hours for which the Post Offices
are now closed, does not exceed one hundred and ten hours, being
on an average one hour and a half for each place.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Even in that document are contained the names of several Towns in
which the relief thus afforded has amounted to four hours of
additional rest on the Sunday.&nbsp; But I will allow, for
argument&rsquo;s sake, the entire correctness of their
calculations.&nbsp; In seventy-three Country Post Offices the
average of relief amounts but to one hour and a half.&nbsp; The
Government, in the meantime, has received returns, not from
seventy-three, but from upwards of four hundred and eighty Towns,
in which the amount of relief has varied from one half-hour to
seven hours on the Sunday, and the average has amounted to
between three and four hours.&nbsp; Where is the real
inconsistency <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>of these statements?&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s Day Society,
on a much smaller induction, and with materials (it may be)
carefully selected, arrives at one result; the Government, on
larger and less partial information, presents another.&nbsp; But
in this case again, I ask, can I doubt for one moment which to
follow?</p>
<p>You express some hesitation as to the justice of one statement
contained in my Letter, that the new Regulation involves no
change of principle. <a name="citation19a"></a><a
href="#footnote19a" class="citation">[19a]</a>&nbsp; You consider
that the attendance on Sunday in the London Post Office, whatever
its extent, has been hitherto private and unnoticed, whereas in
future it will be public and notorious.&nbsp; Nor can I deny that
the publicity which has been given to the subject by the recent
agitation has attracted to the proceedings of the Post Office a
degree of public attention to which they were never before
exposed.&nbsp; But the distinction you draw, though I understand
it, seems to me somewhat arbitrary.&nbsp; The attendance of the
twenty-six <a name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a> will <i>henceforth</i>, at all events,
be as notorious <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>as that of the twenty-five, <a name="citation20a"></a><a
href="#footnote20a" class="citation">[20a]</a> or the six. <a
name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b"
class="citation">[20b]</a>&nbsp; Henceforth, at all events, the
two objects of Sunday attendance will be separated by no such
line of distinction.&nbsp; If the one does not involve publicity,
does not constitute what can fairly be called an opening of the
London Post Office, neither will the other.&nbsp; The Public will
have no admission.&nbsp; The London Public will be unaffected by
the change.&nbsp; As far as London is concerned, the Office will
still be closed.&nbsp; If the former attendance was not enough to
open it, the present Regulation, when the tumult of this
agitation has once subsided, will work no less privately.&nbsp;
If it is otherwise now, whose fault is it?</p>
<p>The Author of the Reply, with singular inconsistency, has thus
disposed of this part of the question.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Office in
London has been considered as uniformly at rest, and always
spoken of as such by both parties, the slight exceptions being
not of a nature to be cited honestly against that
position.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="citation20c"></a><a
href="#footnote20c" class="citation">[20c]</a>&nbsp; Slight
exceptions!&nbsp; Is this the <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>same hand which penned the ninth
axiom? <a name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a>&nbsp; Twenty-six Post Office clerks,
involved in perils such as he has painted, a slight exception,
not of a nature to be cited honestly!&nbsp; Why then the
twenty-five, or the six, or the gradually vanishing number, of
<i>additional</i> clerks required by the new measure?</p>
<p>Again, you can see no obvious connection between the
additional Sunday labour in London and the additional Sunday rest
in the country Offices.&nbsp; Is it fair, you ask, to append to a
measure of relief a condition of an opposite kind?&nbsp; You
would be the last man in the world, I well know, to impute to me
(even as &ldquo;an elegant close to a period&rdquo; <a
name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b"
class="citation">[21b]</a>) the horrid and impious crime of
&ldquo;striking a balance with Jehovah&rdquo; by &ldquo;offering
Him a lesser sin instead of a greater.&rdquo; <a
name="citation21c"></a><a href="#footnote21c"
class="citation">[21c]</a>&nbsp; You would not call it a sin in
one member of a family to endeavour to lighten the Sunday labour
of another by the sacrifice of a portion of his own Sunday
leisure.&nbsp; You would not call it a violation of the
consciences of others, or an exchange <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of sin for sin, if the Master of a
family proposed to his servants such an equalization of their
Sunday employments.&nbsp; And on the same principle, if there be
any connection between Sunday work in London and Sunday relief in
the country, I cannot admit for one moment that it is a sin to
propose to a clerk in the London Post Office the discharge of a
duty which shall lighten the work elsewhere, not of one, but of
tens and perhaps hundreds, of his fellow-servants; and this,
without forfeiting for himself the opportunity of attending
Divine service twice on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, with all comfort
and quietness, and with leisure, besides, for reflection and
repose. <a name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a"
class="citation">[22a]</a>&nbsp; Are domestic servants, to speak
generally, even in Christian families, in a more favourable
position than this for their religious welfare?&nbsp; The Author
of the Reply objects to these &ldquo;national&rdquo; views of the
question.&nbsp; With him, &ldquo;national&rdquo; is the opposite
of &ldquo;scriptural&rdquo; and &ldquo;spiritual.&rdquo; <a
name="citation22b"></a><a href="#footnote22b"
class="citation">[22b]</a>&nbsp; He can see nothing but the
individual; the &ldquo;one Post Office clerk.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
would deny the <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>applicability to a nation of the command to &ldquo;bear
one another&rsquo;s burdens.&rdquo;&nbsp; What in a family would
be virtues, in a wider sphere are sins.</p>
<p>Your view, I am persuaded, is not thus microscopic.&nbsp; You
will grant the conclusion, if the premises are established.&nbsp;
Your only doubt is as to the effect of the labour here upon the
labour there.&nbsp; The Government have coupled the burden and
the relief; but is there any real and natural connection?&nbsp;
It was the object of my Letter to indicate, chiefly by references
to Mr. Hill&rsquo;s Minute, the existence of this
connection.&nbsp; I will not repeat now the obvious statement
that the cessation of the Sunday detention of letters in London
will obviate at once those circuitous methods of communication by
which the detention was formerly evaded, and Sunday labour, in
various ways, materially increased. <a name="citation23"></a><a
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp; I will rather
select the point to which you particularly direct my
attention.&nbsp; And I would show you, as briefly as possible,
the operation of the new Order in diminishing the amount of
letters <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>delivered and read, written and posted, in the country
on the Sunday. <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a></p>
<p>Under the old system, the average number of letters passing
through the London Office was greater by six per cent. on
Saturday than on other days.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it was
known that the following was a blank post.&nbsp; If not
transmitted before Sunday, they must wait in London throughout
that day.&nbsp; Now the augmentation of letters passing through
London on Saturday caused an augmentation of letters delivered
and read in the country on Sunday.&nbsp; The effect of the new
Regulation is at least to obviate this <i>excess</i>, and to
reduce the Sunday morning delivery in the country to the measure
of an ordinary day.&nbsp; The labours of sorting and of
distribution will be diminished obviously to a proportionate
extent.</p>
<p>Again, the average number of letters passing through London on
Monday was greater, not by six, but by twenty-five per cent.,
than on other days.&nbsp; Such letters must have been posted in
the country either on Saturday evening or on Sunday.&nbsp; But <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Saturday
evening, under the old system, was in most Towns a blank post
time.&nbsp; Sunday, therefore, was the day to which the excess
was to be attributed.&nbsp; The knowledge that letters posted on
Saturday evening would lie in London till the Monday, led to a
very general habit of either writing, or at least posting,
letters on the Sunday.&nbsp; The latter habit, equally with the
former, involved a corresponding increase of the Sunday labours
of the country Offices.&nbsp; Under the present system, the
temptation to prefer Sunday for either purpose is removed.&nbsp;
Saturday now offers equal advantages with any other day for
sending letters from the country through London.&nbsp; In the
same degree, the burdens of the country Offices on Sunday are
lightened: the <i>excess</i>, at least, of those burdens, a
marked and heavy excess, above those of common days, is
effectually removed.&nbsp; And, beyond this, the religious
feeling which leads so many to shrink from such an employment of
the Lord&rsquo;s Day cannot but operate in diminishing the Sunday
occupations (in this respect) of the country Offices even
<i>below</i> <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>those of other days.&nbsp; Of the actual result, the
relief actually experienced in the provincial Offices, I have
before spoken. <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; And it is the cessation of the
Sunday detention&mdash;in other words, the introduction of a
Sunday transmission through London&mdash;to which, as you have
seen, the result, whatever it be, is strictly and wholly due.</p>
<p>I believe that a similar examination of other details would
establish with equal certainty this connection of cause and
effect between the Regulation itself and the beneficial
result.&nbsp; But, were it otherwise, is it a reasonable demand
that the connection between the different sections of the new
Order should be, in every point, capable of mathematical
demonstration?&nbsp; Is every complex measure to be stigmatized
as a fraud, because its component parts, however perfect their
harmony, do not arise out of each other by a logical
sequence?&nbsp; Might not even an apparently extraneous appendage
(though I am far from regarding this as a just description of any
part of the present Regulation) be accepted <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>as at least
an indication of the spirit and object of the framer?</p>
<p>There is yet another point, which has left on your mind, as on
that of others, an unfavourable impression.&nbsp; The attendance
of the additional Clerks on Sunday in the London Post Office is
voluntary.&nbsp; In other words, a man whose conscience forbids
him to attend on the Sunday shall not forfeit his situation by
refusal.&nbsp; Does this imply, on the part of the Government,
any mis-giving as to the lawfulness of the duties proposed?&nbsp;
It merely recognizes the possibility of such scruples, and
extends to them the amplest toleration.&nbsp; That there
<i>are</i> men who would think such attendance wrong, is a matter
of fact: the Government tolerates, though it does not share, the
opinion, and would prevent its operating harshly upon the
fortunes of the conscientious recusant.&nbsp; How loud an outcry,
from the very same quarters, would have followed a system of
<i>compulsion</i>, may be inferred from the strange contradiction
which &ldquo;closes a period&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Reply.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He must be a very prejudiced
man who calls the poor <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>clerk a voluntary agent in the
matter, when he is enticed by a bribe, which his small salary
makes an irresistible temptation, or compelled by the fear of the
loss of his only means of subsistence.&rdquo; <a
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The poor clerk&rdquo; is
not threatened with the loss of his subsistence: that he is not,
was urged just now against the authors of the measure as a proof
of conscious guilt or weakness.</p>
<p>But is it not, you ask, too strong a temptation to a man of
infirm religious principles, to offer him a reward for Sunday
labour?&nbsp; Can you expect him to resist the
&ldquo;bribe?&rdquo;&nbsp; And if afterwards this voluntary
labour should lie heavily on his conscience, how could you
justify to yourself your own share in his transgression?&nbsp;
Now, if the act proposed be in itself, and of necessity, a sin;
if no consideration of motives or circumstances can justify the
occupation of any portion of the Sunday in the most urgent of
worldly concerns; he, certainly, is deeply guilty, who proposes
it, even with an alternative, to the choice of his
neighbour.&nbsp; But, if this be one of those questions <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>on which
God&rsquo;s Word leaves scope, within certain limits, for the
exercise of an individual judgment; if, in reducing to practical
detail the admitted duty of a religious observance of the Sunday,
one man may conscientiously approve what another no less
conscientiously condemns, and it remains only that &ldquo;every
man be fully persuaded in his own mind;&rdquo; then the demand
made by this Regulation upon the candour and courage of those to
whom it offers the work and the wages, is no greater than that
which must daily be encountered by all who labour for their own
bread, and would do so in the fear of God.&nbsp; To none does it
propose, as the Author of the Reply would lead us to imagine, the
surrender of religious instruction and worship, the abandonment
of all opportunity of serious meditation, or the devotion of the
Lord&rsquo;s Day to the service of a &ldquo;godless or
thoughtless multitude.&rdquo; <a name="citation29a"></a><a
href="#footnote29a" class="citation">[29a]</a>&nbsp; On the
contrary, the possibility of such profanation, within the
precincts to which its authority extends, the Order in question
expressly and peremptorily precludes. <a
name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b"
class="citation">[29b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>There
remains, however, on the minds of many, an impression, scarcely
affected by the most conclusive reply to individual objections,
that the result, if not the object, of the late alteration will
be a delivery of letters on the Sunday in London.&nbsp; Hitherto,
it is said, the merchants of London have enjoyed, and have
thought themselves entitled to enjoy, an advantage in this
respect over the merchants of Bristol or of Liverpool.&nbsp;
Letters arriving in London on the Sunday were in their possession
at a far earlier hour on the Monday than that at which they could
reach the hands of their provincial rivals.&nbsp; Can it be
expected that the loss of this advantage will be borne with
patience?&nbsp; Will not an irresistible clamour demand some
compensation?&nbsp; And what can this compensation be, but a
Sunday delivery of letters in London?&nbsp; Now let it be
remembered, in the first place, that the advantage lost by London
is not given to the country.&nbsp; No one pretends to say that by
means of the Sunday transmission through London the provincial
merchant will receive his letters <i>earlier</i> than the
metropolitan.&nbsp; <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>The injury complained of is at last but equality.&nbsp;
The complaint rests only on the supposition that the London
merchant has a right to an <i>advantage</i> over his provincial
competitor.&nbsp; And, if this advantage has been once lost; if
the claim to superiority has once been set aside; if the
interests of every country merchant throughout England are now
concerned in preventing its restoration; may it not be expected
that the clamours of London for the reestablishment of inequality
will be balanced by the clamours of the provinces for the
maintenance of equality?&nbsp; But, again, from what quarter
shall we expect the demand for a Sunday delivery in London?&nbsp;
The merchants of London have pledged themselves, by the terms of
their late remonstrances, to the principle of Sunday
observance.&nbsp; They have availed themselves of the
<i>religious</i> argument in their recent agitation.&nbsp; They
have urged the sacred right of every Englishman to his seventh
day of rest.&nbsp; Is it to be supposed, that they who have
resisted, on religious grounds, the slightest possible
interference with the completeness <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of the Sabbatical rest, are prepared
now to revenge their disappointment by clamouring for a wide and
sweeping desecration?&nbsp; If any examples of so lamentable an
inconsistency should unhappily be presented, nothing more can be
required, as an exposure of the <i>new</i> agitation, than a
reference to the recorded principles of the old.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have now discharged, however imperfectly, the task imposed
upon me by circumstances which I must still deplore.&nbsp;
Earnestly, most earnestly, do I desire the thankful and reverent
observance of the Lord&rsquo;s Day, with which I believe our
national as well as individual welfare to be closely, inseparably
linked.&nbsp; Deeply do I lament the condition of those weary and
comfortless labourers, who are cut off from the inestimable
blessings to be derived from its holy rest.&nbsp; It is because I
believe that many of the provincial officers of our national Post
Office are involved in this calamity, and that the present
measure contemplates, and in part effects, their <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>emancipation,
that I have condemned the blind hostility with which it has been
assailed, and laboured to expose the misrepresentations by which
that hostility has been fostered.</p>
<p>While, however, the late alteration has been, in my opinion, a
measure of relief, for which many will have cause to be thankful,
it is not a final measure.&nbsp; The Government itself has not so
regarded it.&nbsp; Other measures of Sunday relief have followed
and are following it in quick succession.&nbsp; Already the order
is given for the final closing (as a general rule) of every
country Post Office on the Sunday, at ten o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.&nbsp; I have intimated in my former Letter the
particular hopes which I entertain of a still further reform. <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a>&nbsp; I do not <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>despair of
the arrival of a day when every Post Office throughout England
and Wales shall have followed yet more completely the example of
the Post Office of London; when the ordinary delivery of letters
shall be totally suspended every where on the Sunday, while at
the same time, from a due regard to the infinite necessities of a
great country in an advanced stage of civilization, the sanctity
of the day of rest is not so interpreted as to shorten
practically by one the six days of labour.&nbsp; To this extent,
at least, my own hopes and wishes are carried.&nbsp; If it should
prove that even more than this can safely be attempted; that the
transmission, as well as the delivery, of letters may from the
Saturday to the Monday be suspended; far be it from me to raise a
finger in hindrance of so unexpected, yet theoretically so
desirable, a result.&nbsp; Let me only express a hope, that, if
this demand be seriously urged upon the attention of the
Government and the Legislature, it may not be made in a spirit
which must rouse the just indignation of those to whom it is
addressed, <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

reasonable mind.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
